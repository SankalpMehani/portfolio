# English Premier League Predictor

## Overview
This project is an English Premier League (EPL) season predictor that utilizes various regression algorithms to forecast the outcomes of the current EPL season. By implementing machine learning models, this tool aims to provide insights into team performance and potential standings in the league.


## Models Used
The following regression algorithms were used in this project:

KNeighborsRegressor

DecisionTreeRegressor

RandomForestRegressor

AdaBoostRegressor

GradientBoostingRegressor

XGBRegressor

CatBoostRegressor

Each of these models was trained and evaluated to provide predictions for the EPL season.
